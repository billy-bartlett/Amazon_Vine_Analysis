## Summary
Comparing both 5-star reviews for the Vine and non-Vine categories to the total number of reviews, shows that the Vine reviews won't signifigantly impact the numbers.

The Vine reviews, when divided by the total Vine reviews, shows a percent of 1.1% being 5-star reviews. The non-Vine reviews show a percent of .88%. These percentages indicate that there is a bias when reviewers are being paid. If this program were to expand, we would likely see a rise in positive reviews from reviewers being paid.

To further test bias, we could take other datasets and determine if we see a higher percentage of positive reviews from reviewers being paid.
