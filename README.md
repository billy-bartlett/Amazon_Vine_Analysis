# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analyisis was to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews when the customer is paid to review a product. The dataset used contained a total of 1,785,997 video game reviews on Amazon. Vine Reviews is an Amazon program that pays customers to review products. Below we will compare the Vine review numbers to determine if these reviews make any signifigant impact on our total review data.

## Summary
Comparing both 5-star reviews for the Vine and non-Vine categories to the total number of reviews shows that the Vine reviews do not significantly impact the numbers.

However, digging deeper into the review numbers, I did additional calculations for the Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews. When dividing the total Vine reviews with the total Vine 5-star reviews, we see a percent of 1.1%. In comparison, the non-Vine reviews show a percent of .88%. These percentages indicate that there is a bias when reviewers are being paid. If this program were to expand, we would likely see a rise in positive reviews from reviewers being paid.

To further test bias, we could take other datasets and determine if we see a higher percentage of positive reviews from reviewers being paid.
